Webscraping may also be done at any time and will work in the background, and update the "last scraped" area when it is done. The website appears to only host the most recent 3 months of data, so this should be done AT MINIMUM every two months to not miss out on any data. But, the webscraping generally only takes a few minutes so can and should be done more often.
